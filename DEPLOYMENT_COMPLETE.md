🎉 Full-Stack DCF Calculator - Railway Deployment Complete!
===========================================================

✅ Your application has been successfully configured as a full-stack app and deployed to Railway!

## What was configured:

### 🏗️ Build Process:
- **nixpacks.toml**: Configured Railway to install both Node.js and Python
- **build_frontend.py**: Python script that builds the React app and copies static files
- **railway.json**: Updated with build command to run the frontend build

### 🌐 Frontend Configuration:
- **API Endpoints**: React app now uses environment-based URLs
  - Development: http://localhost:8000
  - Production: Same origin as the deployed app
- **project/src/config/api.ts**: Centralized API configuration

### 🚀 Backend Updates:
- **Static File Serving**: FastAPI now serves the built React app
- **SPA Routing**: Catch-all route handles React Router client-side routing
- **Health Check**: Updated to use /health endpoint for Railway monitoring

### 📁 File Structure:
```
