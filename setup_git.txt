Git Setup Commands for Railway Deployment
=========================================

1. First install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. Then run these commands in your project directory:

cd "d:\ai proj\Intrinsic-Value-Calculator-main"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Railway deployment configuration"

3. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it: intrinsic-value-calculator
   - Don't initialize with README (since we already have code)
   - Click "Create repository"

4. Connect your local repo to GitHub:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intrinsic-value-calculator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

5. Deploy on Railway:
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the configuration and deploy

Alternative: If you don't want to install Git, you can upload files directly to GitHub through the web interface.
